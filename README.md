## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learnt how to structure and position contents in the centerusing flexbox. With this, I was able to increase my knowledge on flexbox

See below the code:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin: 0;
  gap: 10px;
}
```
### Continued development

I would continue to expand my knowledge in flexbox, CSS Grid, and also learn to add javaScript for responsiveness.
